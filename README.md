# CSV-Handler

Full-stack app developed in React + Tailwindcss + Express + DrizzleORM.

Developed as a challenge for Shaw&Partners.

## Features
It's basically an app that receives csv-files, parses them, enforces the database schema, updates data in the client, and displays it in order to be queried.
It has it all! Ghost loaders, spinners, all form errors are properly handled and displayed to the user in a nice and convenient way.

# Deployment

You can find the web on [CSV HANDLER](https://csv-handler.vercel.app/).
